            Avoor is a village located about 10-12 kilometers south of Kumbakonam,
             Tamil Nadu, India. It's home to the Pasupatheeswarar Temple, 
             a significant Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva.
              This ancient temple is one of the 70 Maadakovils built by Chola king Kochengat Chola in the 2nd century AD and is revered in the verses of Tevaram, a 7th-century Tamil Saiva canonical work.
